            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                Hi, I am <span class="highlight">Surendra Mahara</span>, passionate and driven individual with a
                background in
                <span class="highlight">B-Tech in Mechanical Engineering</span> and experience as an <span
                    class="highlight">Industrial Design Engineer</span> and <span class="highlight">Drafter</span>.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am passionate about mechanical engineering, having completed my B.Tech in the field. My journey began
                with hands-on experiences during college, where I worked on various projects and gained practical
                insights. One highlight was my final year internship at a food machinery manufacturing company, where I
                focused on designing and optimizing machinery. This experience deepened my understanding of mechanical
                design principles and prepared me for the professional world.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, I am employed as a Junior Design Engineer at an Australian-based company, where I am involved
                in diverse mechanical design projects. My role encompasses a wide range of tasks, including creating
                models, drafting for manufacturing, generating shop drawings, developing products, designing structures,
                conducting reverse engineering models, and working on piping systems. Each project challenges me to
                apply my technical knowledge and problem-solving skills effectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working in this role has been an enriching experience. I've had the opportunity to collaborate with
                experienced engineers and learn from their expertise. I am continuously expanding my skills in modeling
                software, gaining proficiency in creating detailed designs that are ready for manufacturing. Drafting
                for manufacturing involves translating engineering drawings into instructions that production teams can
                use to build components accurately. It's a crucial step that ensures the designs meet quality standards
                and are feasible to produce.
            </p>
            <p>
                Shop drawings are detailed plans that provide instructions for fabricating and assembling components.
                Developing new products requires creativity and a thorough understanding of market needs and technical
                requirements. It's about innovating solutions that are not only functional but also efficient and
                cost-effective. Structural design involves designing frameworks and support systems that can withstand
                loads and stresses, ensuring safety and durability.
            </p>
            <p>
                Reverse engineering modeling involves analyzing existing products or components to understand their
                design and functionality. This process helps in improving or reproducing them with better materials or
                technologies. Piping design focuses on creating systems for fluid transportation within structures,
                ensuring efficient flow and minimal energy loss.
            </p>
            <p>
                My career goal is to make a positive impact through my work in mechanical engineering. I am dedicated to
                continuous learning, seeking out opportunities to enhance my skills and stay updated with industry
                advancements. This proactive approach allows me to tackle new challenges with confidence and contribute
                effectively to my team's success.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond technical skills, I prioritize communication and teamwork. Collaborating with colleagues from
                different departments and disciplines enhances the overall project outcomes. Clear communication ensures
                that everyone is aligned on project goals and timelines, fostering a supportive and productive work
                environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                In conclusion, my journey as a Mechanical Design Engineer has been shaped by diverse experiencesâ€”from
                academic projects and internships to professional roles. Each opportunity has contributed to my growth,
                equipping me with the skills and knowledge needed to excel in the field. I am committed to leveraging my
                expertise to develop innovative solutions and contribute meaningfully to the advancement of mechanical
                engineering practices. As I continue to evolve in my career, I look forward to taking on new challenges
                and making a lasting impact in the industry.
